# **Elliot Alderson – Cybersecurity Engineer**

[View the live project here.](https://pedromiguelferreira.github.io/elliot-alderson-cybersecurity-engineer/)

This is a portfolio website for Elliot Alderson, a freelance cybersecurity engineer. He provides consultation, design and development of cybersecurity projects for independent clients. The site is also dedicated to the character of Elliot Alderson in *Mr. Robot*, an American drama thriller television series, and we can find several references to the show on this website. One of the main points of interest in *Mr. Robot* is the blend of reality and fantasy in Elliot Alderson's mind, making it hard for the audience to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and the creator of this website tried to recreate some of that blend by mixing elements from the show with socially acceptable, professional content that users would normally find in a portfolio website for a freelance cybersecurity engineer. It’s designed to be interactive, responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential clients and/or fans of *Mr. Robot*.

## **User Experience (UX)**

### **•	User Stories**

#### **o	First-Time Visitor Goals**

**a.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson and, because I’m a fan, I want to enjoy the several references to the TV show this fictitious character belongs to (*Mr. Robot*). This mixture of reality and fantasy/fiction is a recurrent theme on the show and its purpose is obvious to any fan who visits the website whether they’re potential clients or not.

**b.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

**c.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to locate Elliot Alderson’s social media links to see his followings on social media, look for user testimonials and determine how trusted and known he is before I do business with him.

#### **o	Returning Visitor Goals**

**a.**	As a returning visitor, I need to use the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson (again or for the first time), or I want to find the best way to get in contact with him with any questions I may have about his services and how I can use them on my projects.

**b.**	As a returning visitor, I want to enjoy the references to/content about/external links to *Mr. Robot*’s universe again – I like the themeable customization of the website and how it makes me feel like a hacker and part of an exclusive and dangerous community, which is very exciting.

#### **o	Frequent User Goals**

**a.**	As a frequent user, I need to use the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson again, or to get in contact with him with any questions I may have about his services and how I can use them on more projects of mine.

**b.**	As a frequent user, I want to use the external links on the website to check if there are any newly added posts/updates about Elliot Alderson’s work or *Mr. Robot* on social media and other fansites.

### **•	Design**

#### **o	Color Scheme**

**a.**	Two of the colors used on this website revolve around the colors of *Mr. Robot*'s logo on the TV show: black and red, which lend a dramatic and dangerous look to the navbar, the footer and the hacker mode toggle switch and help create the noir ambiance so typical of Elliot Alderson's world in *Mr. Robot*. On dark mode, this is even more important, merging the black background with a dark/mysterious photo of Elliot Alderson on hacker mode himself. It's a dark world Elliot lives in, hence the black color, very typical of hackers, and the psychological and physical violence in his life is perfectly expressed through the red color. On light/normal mode, and because this is supposed to be a professional portfolio website, a lighter color (in this case, light gray) was used as background color – this was done, first, to avoid a lifeless and too common white color as background (portfolio websites usually use neutral background colors, like white, gray or black – this is done not to distract the users so they can focus on the portfolio of projects, which are usually multicolored) and, second, to optimize readability by providing good contrast between a light background color and a much darker text color (in this case, black was used as text color). The text color used in dark mode is, for many reasons, white: first, because it's the best color when the background color used is black (for readability reasons) and, second, and because Elliot Alderson and *Mr. Robot* are both about hacking, the white text on a black screen perfectly imitates a hacker at work, as seen throughout the TV show (an opacity of 0.87 was used as pure white on a back background is bad for the eyes – this is quite common among programmers, hackers and other dark mode users). Given the content and the theme of the website, I believe this black-red-white-light gray four-color combination works well, suits the layout and triggers a good emotional response from the users, whether they're clients or fans.

#### **o	Typography**

**a.**	Fira Code is [the most used programming font in the world](https://www.slant.co/versus/268/301/~fira-mono_vs_fira-code), and it made sense to use it on a website dedicated to an IT professional and hacker (in dark mode, with a black background, it most definitely looks like a hacker's workspace, something seen all the time in *Mr. Robot*). It's elegant and easy to read, yet it gives content a mysterious/dangerous/illegal feel, with sans-serif as the fallback font in case, for some reason, the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I believe its style suits the content, the layout, the purpose and, in some way, the dark web-ish feeling this website wants to create in its users.

#### **o	Imagery**

**a.**	Portfolio websites usually have a nice, friendly-looking photo of the author of the projects/creator of the website on the main page (followed by a name and a short introduction), so the same layout was used here. Elliot Alderson is not the most photogenic or friendly-looking person in the world (very much on purpose, as he's a very troubled young man), and the photo used on this website reflects that by aligning it with the dark aura of the character in *Mr. Robot*, but still portraying him as a legit/believable freelance cybersecurity engineer. When the user hovers over the main image, it changes, showing us a photo of *Mr. Robot* himself, Elliot's dark side as seen on the TV show (it was made slightly bigger in order to give the user that dramatic, in-your-face and sudden change to Elliot's dangerous alter ego). Both images were also made slightly grayer to give them that typical noir look of *Mr. Robot*'s universe, and their background was also altered in order for it to blend with the background color of the body of the website used for the light mode. When the user chooses to view the website in dark/hacker mode, the image changes to a more mysterious photo of Elliot, showing him wearing his famous black hoodie, very hacker-like, which matches the black background and, at the same time, presents the user with a striking and kind of scary layout, so typical of the TV show this character comes from.

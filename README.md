# **Elliot Alderson – Cybersecurity Engineer**

[View the live project here.](https://pedromiguelferreira.github.io/elliot-alderson-cybersecurity-engineer/)

This is a portfolio website for Elliot Alderson, a freelance cybersecurity engineer. He provides consultation, design and development of cybersecurity projects for independent clients. The site is also dedicated to the character of Elliot Alderson in *Mr. Robot*, an American drama thriller television series, and we can find several references to the show on this website. One of the main points of interest in *Mr. Robot* is the blend of reality and fantasy in Elliot Alderson's mind, making it hard for the audience to distinguish between fantasy and reality, and the creator of this website tried to recreate some of that blend by mixing elements from the show with socially acceptable, professional content that users would normally find in a portfolio website for a freelance cybersecurity engineer. It’s designed to be interactive, responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential clients and/or fans of *Mr. Robot*.

## **User Experience (UX)**

### **•	User Stories**

#### **o	First-Time Visitor Goals**

**a.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson and, because I’m a fan, I want to enjoy the several references to the TV show this fictitious character belongs to (*Mr. Robot*). This mixture of reality and fantasy/fiction is a recurrent theme on the show and its purpose is obvious to any fan who visits the website whether they’re potential clients or not.

**b.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

**c.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to locate Elliot Alderson’s social media links to see his followings on social media, look for user testimonials and determine how trusted and known he is before I do business with him.

#### **o	Returning Visitor Goals**

**a.**	As a returning visitor, I need to use the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson (again or for the first time), or I want to find the best way to get in contact with him with any questions I may have about his services and how I can use them on my projects.

**b.**	As a returning visitor, I want to enjoy the references to/content about/external links to *Mr. Robot*’s universe again – I like the themeable customization of the website and how it makes me feel like a hacker and part of an exclusive and dangerous community, which is very exciting.

#### **o	Frequent User Goals**

**a.**	As a frequent user, I need to use the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson again, or to get in contact with him with any questions I may have about his services and how I can use them on more projects of mine.

**b.**	As a frequent user, I want to use the external links on the website to check if there are any newly added posts/updates about Elliot Alderson’s work or *Mr. Robot* on social media and other fansites.

### **•	Design**

#### **o	Color Scheme**

**a.**	Two of the colors used on this website revolve around the colors of *Mr. Robot*'s logo on the TV show: black and red, which lend a dramatic and dangerous look to the navbar, the footer, the hacker mode toggle switch and all hyperlinks throughout the site and help create the noir ambiance so typical of Elliot Alderson's world in *Mr. Robot*. On dark mode, this is even more important, merging the black background with a dark/mysterious photo of Elliot Alderson on hacker mode himself. It's a dark world Elliot lives in, hence the black color, very typical of hackers, and the psychological and physical violence in his life is perfectly expressed through the red color. On light/normal mode, and because this is supposed to be a professional portfolio website, a lighter color (in this case, light gray) was used as background color – this was done, first, to avoid a lifeless and too common white color as background (portfolio websites usually use neutral background colors, like white, gray or black – this is done not to distract the users so they can focus on the portfolio of projects, which are usually multicolored) and, second, to optimize readability by providing good contrast between a light background color and a much darker text color (in this case, black was used as text color). The text color used in dark mode is, for many reasons, white: first, because it's the best color when the background color used is black (for readability reasons) and, second, and because Elliot Alderson and *Mr. Robot* are both about hacking, the white text on a black screen perfectly imitates a hacker at work, as seen throughout the TV show (an opacity of 0.87 was used as pure white on a back background is bad for the eyes – this is quite common among programmers, hackers and other dark mode users). Given the content and the theme of the website, I believe this black-red-white-light gray four-color combination works well, suits the layout and triggers a good emotional response from the users, whether they're clients or fans.

#### **o	Typography**

**a.**	Fira Code is [the most used programming font in the world](https://www.slant.co/versus/268/301/~fira-mono_vs_fira-code), and it made sense to use it on a website dedicated to an IT professional and hacker (in dark mode, with a black background, it most definitely looks like a hacker's workspace, something seen all the time in *Mr. Robot*). It's elegant and easy to read, yet it gives content a mysterious/dangerous/illegal feel, with sans-serif as the fallback font in case, for some reason, the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. I believe its style suits the content, the layout, the purpose and, in some way, the dark web-ish feeling this website wants to create in its users.

#### **o	Imagery**

**a.**	Portfolio websites usually have a nice, friendly-looking photo of the author of the projects/creator of the website on the main page (followed by a name and a short introduction), so the same layout was used here. Elliot Alderson is not the most photogenic or friendly-looking person in the world (very much on purpose, as he's a very troubled young man), and the photo used on this website reflects that by aligning it with the dark aura of the character in *Mr. Robot*, but still portraying him as a legit/believable freelance cybersecurity engineer. When the user hovers over the main image, it changes, showing us a photo of *Mr. Robot* himself, Elliot's dark side as seen on the TV show (it was made slightly bigger in order to give the user that dramatic, in-your-face and sudden change to Elliot's dangerous alter ego). Both images were also made slightly grayer to give them that typical noir look of *Mr. Robot*'s universe, and their background was also altered in order for it to blend with the background color of the body of the website used for the light mode. When the user chooses to view the website in dark/hacker mode, the image changes to a more mysterious photo of Elliot, showing him wearing his famous black hoodie, very hacker-like, which matches the black background and, at the same time, presents the user with a striking and kind of scary layout, so typical of the TV show this character comes from. Also, there's a favicon on the browser's tab (the symbol of fsociety, the hacker group created by Elliot in *Mr. Robot* – very appropriately, it's the image of a Guy Fawkes-like mask, an international symbol for hacking).

## **Features**

•	Responsive on all device sizes

•	Interactive elements (described on each of the following website sections)

•	Navigation Bar

o	Featured at the top of the scrolling single-page, the fully responsive navigation/link bar introduces the user to all the specific content on the website by showing links (hover.css was used to add an underline effect to each link while being hovered over) to the Home section, the Education section, the Experience section, the Skills section, the Projects section, the Contact section and the About section. It's a sticky navigation/link bar, so it follows the user's viewport as he/she scrolls down the long single-page, allowing the user to easily navigate through the content across all devices without having to go back to the top of the page to access other sections. It obeys the combination of colors described on the Color Scheme section of this document, and it also contains *Mr Robot*'s logo, and the combination of colors used was created around it. Though its layout seems a bit similar to the navbar created for the first project by the creator of this website (which was a sticky navbar, too and, purely as a coincidence, it just so happens to have seven links as well), its style is different, it's different in the way it looks, in the way it was coded and in the way it responds to different device sizes. And, because it fits the style of the site that its creator envisioned, the final version seems appropriate (the creator of this website believes that there's no need to create a completely different navbar just for it to be completely different – again, this kind of navbar layout seems to suit this kind of site, and it is believed to look different enough not to be considered too close to the one on the previous project).

[Screenshot of the navbar here](assets/docs/navbar-screenshot.png)

•	The Home Section

o	The Home section works as the landing page, which predictably includes a photo of the cybersecurity engineer who owns this portfolio website (Elliot Alderson) and some introductory text describing the purpose of the site next to it. It also includes a dark mode toggle switch, which can be used to view the website in dark mode (or, jokingly, in Hacker Mode – a reference to the TV show, for fans only). As explained on the Imagery sub-section of this README.md file, when the user hovers over the main image, it changes, showing us a photo of *Mr. Robot* himself, Elliot's dark side as seen on the TV show (it was made slightly bigger in order to give the user that dramatic, in-your-face and sudden change to Elliot's dangerous alter ego). It's the same in dark mode, but the image of Elliot is different (a darker, more mysterious one was used) and it doesn't change when hovered over. In mobile devices, and because the layout has to be responsive and fit images and text into a smaller space, the image appears stacked on top of the introductory text and the dark mode toggle switch.

[Screenshot of the Home section in light mode here](assets/docs/home-section-light-mode-screenshot.png)

[Screenshot of the Home section in dark mode here](assets/docs/home-section-dark-mode-screenshot.png)

•	The Education Section

o	A resume-like list of Elliot Alderson's education. This is completely made up by the creator of this website, based on information about real cybersecurity engineers found online (these details are not disclosed on the TV show, and most fans assume Elliot was self-taught), but it's necessary information in a portfolio website. It includes a BA in Computer Science in Princeton University in New Jersey (Elliot lives in New York in *Mr. Robot*) and a list of certifications. This section was coded using an HTML table.

[Screenshot of the Education section here](assets/docs/education-section-screenshot.png)

•	The Experience Section

o	A resume-like list of Elliot Alderson's work experience based on the timeline of the TV show, with the exception of Code Institute's entry (obviously and jokingly made up by the creator of this website – there was a company Elliot worked for before working for Allsafe, but its name is never mentioned in *Mr. Robot*). The clickable links will take the user to a fandom website page about that specific topic of the show. Any external links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding the user to leave the website. This section was also coded using an HTML table.

[Screenshot of the Experience section here](assets/docs/experience-section-screenshot.png)

•	The Skills Section

o	A resume-like list of Elliot Alderson's skills as a cybersecurity engineer and, in a funny way, a hacker (even social engineering is mentioned as a skill). These details are completely made up by the creator of this website, based on information about real cybersecurity engineers found online (except for his hacking skills on the first entry), but it's necessary information in a portfolio website.

[Screenshot of the Skills section here](assets/docs/skills-section-screenshot.png)

•	The Projects Section

o	A resume-like list of Elliot Alderson's projects. One would expect these would be cybersecurity-related projects, but are in fact, and in a humorous manner, all hacking-related, and all they obey the show's timeline (fans will know what these are, potential clients will just be really scared, but also impressed, hopefully). Each clickable link will take the user to a YouTube pages/video about that specific hack as it happened on the show. Any external links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding the user to leave the website. This section was also coded using an HTML table.

[Screenshot of the Projects section here](assets/docs/projects-section-screenshot.png)

•	The Contact Section

o	This section includes two sub-sections: a resume-like list of Elliot Alderson's personal and contact information (all the info is exactly the same as shown on the TV show – this sub-section was also coded using an HTML table) and a contact form with six input fields, including three dropdown menus with several options, that can be used to contact Elliot Alderson by providing personal and contact details as well as a description of the services required by the user, and a submit button. Once submitted, a confirmation page will come up on the screen to validate the submission (in a very Elliot-like way – please see screenshot below) and an email with a copy of the details provided will be sent to the email address provided informing the client that fsociety (another *Mr. Robot* reference) will contact him/her soon with an estimated quote for the services required (the creator of this website receives the same email, too). Responsive design is used on this contact form: if no name is inserted on the "Name" field, an alert pops up to let the user know this information is required in order to proceed. The same happens with the "Email" field, where a proper email address (in email address format) must be inputted.

[Screenshot of the Contact Form confirmation message here](assets/docs/contact-form-confirmation-message-screenshot.png)

[Screenshot of the Contact Form email confirmation here](assets/docs/contact-form-email-confirmation.png)

•	The About Section

o	This section includes a synopsis of *Mr. Robot* and some information about the show, as well as a simple password-cracking test (a final test in order for the user to be able to join fsociety – one of many references to this TV show, as Elliot Alderson is an expert at cracking other people's passwords). A clue is provided, and true fans will figure out the answer but, to make it easy for the Assessment Team, the password can be revealed: it's "whiterose" (in the context of *Mr. Robot*, "God is a pale flower" should be interpreted as "Deus is a white rose" – "Deus" is the latin word for "god", it's also the name of an investment group formed in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union to bring together the world's most powerful and wealthy men to manipulate global events for profit, as it's shown on the show, and Whiterose, one of the main antagonists throughout the show's four seasons, is its founder and leader). If the user gets it right, an alert message with a welcome speech by Elliot pops up; if the user's guess is wrong, an alert message from Elliot saying goodbye pops up. Any external links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user and avoiding the user to leave the website.

•	Footer

o	The footer section includes a “Copyright © 2022 Elliot Alderson” notice – it’s shown on every section of the website (it's a sticky footer, so it follows the user's viewport as he/she scrolls up and down the long single-page website). Just like the navbar, it obeys the combination of colors described on the Color Scheme section of this document. This sticky footer was created as small as possible (differently from the navbar in that sense) as the information on it is not as relevant to the user experience as the navbar, for example, so this keeps the footer from stealing valuable space from the rest of the content of the website. The social media icons on it (for YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook) lead the user to the official social media pages for *Mr. Robot*. No hover.css was used on the social media icons in the footer (to add the float transition while being hovered over) because the footer bar would grow in size momentaneously as the icons were being hovered over, lending a strange visual effect to the user's viewport and the general user experience. Though its layout seems a bit similar to the footer created for the first project by the creator of this website (which was a sticky footer, too and, purely as a coincidence, it just so happens to have four social media icons as well), its style is different, it's different in the way it looks, in the way it was coded and in the way it responds to different device sizes. And, because it fits the style of the site that its creator envisioned, the final version seems appropriate (the creator of this website believes that there's no need to create a completely different footer just for it to be completely different – again, this kind of footer layout seems to suit this kind of site, and it is believed to look different enough not to be considered too close to the one on the previous project).

### **Testing User Stories from the User Experience (UX) Section**

#### **•	First-Time Visitor Goals**

**i.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson and, because I’m a fan, I want to enjoy the several references to the TV show this fictitious character belongs to (*Mr. Robot*). This mixture of reality and fantasy/fiction is a recurrent theme on the show and its purpose is obvious to any fan who visits the website whether they’re potential clients or not.

a.	Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page section of their choice. The logo for *Mr. Robot* on the navbar, an obvious reference to the TV show, together with the photo of Elliot Alderson, the introductory text on the main page and the "Visit this website in Hacker Mode" toggle switch, immediately make the user aware that it's a website about *Mr. Robot* and make the CTA (Call-to-Action) obvious – at this stage, the user wants to know more. A user who is a fan of this TV show will be amused, as it's obvious, because of the information on the navbar and the main page, that it's also a website where cybersecurity services are being offered – by a fictitious character (this user definitely knows what the website is about, what to expect and will want to know more – again, the CTA is obvious). The users who don't know about the show will think that the man on the photo looks a bit odd (and it gets odder when the user hovers over it) and the way he addresses the user on the main page ("Hello, friend", something only Elliot would say) is just weird, but they'll be convinced that it's legit when they read the wording on the navbar ("Education", Experience", "Skills", Projects", Contact, etc.) and the rest of the introductory text on the main page ("I provide consultation, design and development of cybersecurity projects for independent clients"), only to be brought back to a suspicious attitude towards the site when they see the "Visit this website in Hacker Mode" toggle switch – but, at this stage, they want to know more, including the cybersecurity services being offered, and they have all the necessary information and guidance to proceed and explore the rest of the website. And the About section clearly explains what the site is all about. All sections of the site are clearly identified and the content, though sometimes amusing due to the fictitious nature of the website, is clear and accessible for both fans and potential clients. On mobile devices, the users' first impression/experience should be the same.

b.	The user has two options: click the Call-to-Action buttons in the navbar and the main page or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same sections of the site, to learn more about Elliot Alderson's cybersecurity services, *Mr. Robot* or both.

**ii.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.

a.	The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. The sticky navigation bar follows the user's viewport as he/she scrolls up and down the page, and each link describes the section of the website they'll end up at clearly. This way, the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the end of a section or to the end of the page. The confirmation message page for the contact form also has a "Home" button so the user can go back to the main page.

b.	The sticky footer, which also follows the user's viewport throughout any scrolling, allows the user to see who created the site and click on the social media icons to visit those pages at all times (a first-time visitor may want to see Elliot Alderson's followings on social media to know more about him, the services he's offering and/or *Mr. Robot*, or to interact with other fans of the TV show).

c.	All these goals have been achieved by every visitor to this website that I contacted (family, friends, *Mr. Robot* fans, etc.): most fans found it easy to navigate and the content to be entertaining, and most non-fans also found it easy to navigate and also original and acceptable as a website for a weird professional cybersecurity engineer who wants to do business online. Whichever social media link the user clicks on opens in a new tab to ensure he/she can easily get back to the website (the same applies to any other external links on the website).

**iii.**	As a first-time visitor, I want to locate Elliot Alderson’s social media links to see his followings on social media, look for user testimonials and determine how trusted and known he is before I do business with him.

a.	The social media links on the ever-present sticky footer (for YouTube, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook) are easy to access at all times. Having in mind that Elliot Alderson doesn't exist, the social media pages the users will land on are related to the TV show, which, at this stage, has added to the amusement of both fans and non-fans that visited this site.

#### **•	Returning Visitor Goals**

**i.**	As a returning visitor, I need to use the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson (again or for the first time), or I want to find the best way to get in contact with him with any questions I may have about his services and how I can use them on my projects.

a.	I believe the (good) first impression made on most first-time users has paid back, as more family members, friends and *Mr. Robot* fans that I contacted visited the website again to look at the content and use the contact form – and some fans, and even non-fans, said they even emailed Elliot and called the cell phone number provided on the site, some of them believing Elliot actually existed, which is hilarious (the creator of this website never thought that most non-fans he would contact would believe the Elliot portrayed on this site is real, but most of them did), so this goal has been achieved.

**ii.**	As a returning visitor, I want to enjoy the references to/content about/external links to *Mr. Robot*’s universe again – I like the themeable customization of the website and how it makes me feel like a hacker and part of an exclusive and dangerous community, which is very exciting.

a.	The feedback from the fans of the TV show that visited the website and that I contacted provided very positive feedback. The content is considered to be entertaining (including the content that was completely fabricated by the creator of this website), original and believable (including the "serious" parts about Elliot Alderson as a normal, real-world cybersecurity engineer instead of a TV show hacker). The site was also considered to look professional enough to fool non-fans by a few visitors, which made the creator of this website a mildly happy man.

#### **•	Frequent User Goals**

**i.**	As a frequent user, I need to use the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson again, or to get in contact with him with any questions I may have about his services and how I can use them on more projects of mine.

a.	Users would already be comfortable with the website layout and could easily navigate around. Though no user has visited this website frequently in order to provide feedback (it was just created), it is believed that the website provides a good user experience and would allow any frequent users to use the cybersecurity services offered by Elliot Alderson again and again, as well as contact the professional cybersecurity engineer behind this website (if he was real).

**ii.**	As a frequent user, I want to use the external links on the website to check if there are any newly added posts/updates about Elliot Alderson’s work or *Mr. Robot* on social media and other fansites.

a.	This will never change: the social media links on the footer will allow any user to do this at all times.

### **Further Testing**

•	The website was tested on the Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers (on Safari only by my mentor - he confirmed it was fully responsive and functional). It was not tested on Internet Explorer as it's no longer supported.

•	The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as large laptops, medium/smaller laptops, tablets, phablets, larger mobile phones and medium/smaller mobile phones.

•	A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all section links on the navbar were linking correctly. The same was done for all the external links on the website, including the social media icons on the footer bar. All JavaScript functionality (the mouseover/mouseout events for the main images on light mode, the dark mode toggle switch, the contact form confirmation email and the password-cracking test) was also tested on all possible devices.

•	Friends, family members and *Mr. Robot* fans were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### **Known Bugs**

#### **Fixed Bugs**

•	Some sections of the website, due to their resume-like content, were created using a table, which was proving very hard to center on any screen size. [This W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_table_center.asp) on how to center tables with CSS helped solving the issue.

•	The use of tables proved to be a bit problematic, as there was little space between columns, which made the content look funny. The problem was solved by creating space between the columns using zero-width space, and all the information on how to do this was found on [this very good article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/the-zero-width-space-77543a28c984) by David Klempfner on [gitconnected](https://gitconnected.com/).

•	The dark mode toggle switch on the Home section was getting on top of the navbar when scrolling down. This was fixed by using a "z-index: 99;" property, and all the information on how to do this was found on [this very good Stack Overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63263345/i-created-a-fixed-navbar-but-now-the-buttons-are-getting-on-top-of-the-navbar).

•	The mouseover/mouseout events were working perfectly both in light mode and dark mode, but they shouldn't work in dark mode (the image of Elliot in dark mode wasn't suppose to change). After some trial-and-error, and with the precious guidance of Code Institute's Tutor Support, the JavaScript code for this functionality was finally tweaked in a way to make it work as intended.

•	The HTML page for the Contact Form confirmation message was linked to the main index.html page of the website but, when the EmailJS functionality was added to the Contact Form and an email was being sent to the user after submission, the confirmation page was no longer being shown to the user after submission. To redirect the user to the confirmation page after submission, a "window.location.replace()" method was used – the code to do so was found on [this very good W3Schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_redirect_webpage.asp), and my mentor's guidance on this one was particularly useful.

•	Some difficulties were experienced when trying to get the input fields on the Contact Form cleared after submission. The idea to use the "reset()" method come from [this very good article](https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-clear-input-field-after-submit) by Borislav Hadzhiev on [his blog](https://bobbyhadz.com/).

•	There were some issues with the little password-cracking test at the end of the About section. After quite a bit of trial-and-error and research, the simple idea of using the "isValid()" function proved to work just fine, and the code for it was found on [this very good Stack Overflow page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7974040/creating-a-simple-password-validation-field). But when the JavaScript code was tested in JSHint, a warning message was shown, as the isValid() function wasn't being properly called and was coming up as "unused", so an "id" in HTML and an "addEventListener" in JavaScript were added to the code so "isValid()" could be correctly called and the issue was solved – my mentor's guidance on this one was again particularly useful.

#### **Unfixed Bugs**

•	This website is not responsive in mobile devices with a width of less than 320px, as only some smart watches are narrower than 320px (information about this topic can be found, for example, [here](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/74798/are-there-devices-narrower-than-320px-and-data-on-their-usage-for-web-browsing)).

•	Creating space between the columns of the tables used to display content in some sections of the website using zero-width space proved to be a winning idea, but this created a subtle bug, which is only visible when the user hovers over a couple of external links where this happens (the link for "Allsafe Cybersecurity" in the "Experience" section and the link for "November 2014" in the "Projects" section): the user can see an underline effect that is longer than the group of words it's supposed to underline – not by much, but enough to be noticed.

•	One issue that the creator of this website couldn't find a solution for (and several different approaches were tried) is related to the little password-cracking test at the end of the About section: the idea was to use the same "reset()" method used on the Contact Form but, for some unknown reason, it doesn't work in this section of the site. The creator of this website believes it has to do with the different HTML structures used on both sections: the Contact Form section uses "form", "label" and "input" tags (because it's supposed to be a proper contact form), but the Final Test section uses only a "div" and two "input" tags (as it's not a contact form, it's just a continuation of the text on the About section, with a line of text, a password field and a submit button – its structure has to be different). The user can't see the password on the password field (only dots, as it's supposed to be with password fields), but the password field won't clear after submission.

## **Deployment**

### **GitHub Pages**

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/PedroMiguelFerreira/elliot-alderson-cybersecurity-engineer).

2. At the top of the Repository (not top of the page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" section.

4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None", select "Master Branch" and click on "Save".

5. The page will automatically refresh.
